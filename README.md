# RaiseIT
RaiseIT aims to be the next innovation pioneer in IT Sector by being the first centralized system to deal with workplace struggles.
This website will allow employees from all over India from any company to have a platform for registering a workplace issue and have it dealt with fairly.
Any company that fails to do so will have a negative rating on their workplace environment which will be visible globally.
Considering a possibility of an employee misusing this website out of prejudice or ulterior motive, this website will initially have warnings generated on their profile which may later lead to the employee being blocked and a negative mark on their profile.
RaiseIT once implemented will impact the work culture incredibly by bringing everyone on board to improve their experience in companies and have a healthy environment around their career.
